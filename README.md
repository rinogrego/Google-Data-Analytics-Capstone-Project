# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Program by Coursera

## Project 1 - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

**Task**: 

Identifying how do annual members and casual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and then suggest the marketing team how to turn casual members into annual members.

**Process**: 

The data suggests that there is a difference in behaviour between annual members and casual members in terms of the time and the distance of each group members when using the services. Based on that findings then the marketing team can work on the places where the behaviours between the casual members and the annual members are mostly similar.

**Results**: 

**Clark St & Elm St**, **Wells St & Concord Ln**, and **Wells St & Elm St** are the potential locations for our marketing team to convert casual riders into member riders the most compared to another stations.
