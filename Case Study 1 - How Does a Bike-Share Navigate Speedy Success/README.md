# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Program by Coursera.
This is a repository where I did my analysis project by following through the data analysis process taught in the certification program which consists of:

- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

## Project 1 - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### Task

Identifying how do annual members and casual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and then suggest the marketing team how to turn casual members into annual members.

### Analysis

The data suggests that there is a difference in behaviour between annual members and casual members in terms of the time and the distance of each group members when using the services. Based on that findings then the marketing team can work on the places where the behaviours between the casual members and the annual members are mostly similar.

### Result

**Clark St & Elm St**, **Wells St & Concord Ln**, and **Wells St & Elm St** are the potential locations for our marketing team to convert casual riders into member riders the most compared to another stations. 

### To be Analyzed Further

- The most effective hours to do advertising within the area of the stations found
- For each month, find the trend of time where member riders are the most active (e.g. maybe member riders are the most active in July, so try to advertise around that time in order to maximize the conversion rate of casual riders to member riders)
