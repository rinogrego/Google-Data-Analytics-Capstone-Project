# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Program by Coursera.
This is a repository where I did my analysis project by following through the data analysis process taught in the certification program which consists of:

- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

## Project 1 - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### Project Overview

- In the scenario we are asked to solve the question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" to help future marketing program. The goal of the scenario is stated as follows: "Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members"
- I first define 2 things in which the annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently: 
    - The time they took
    - The distance their ride took
- Since the goal is to convert casual riders into annual members, then I try to find the starting stations where the casual riders behave similarly compared with annual members
- The tools used are:
    - Python pandas and numpy for cleaning and transforming, the data,
    - Python matplotlib for data exploration,
    - Python geopy for calculating distance between 2 stations, and 
    - Power BI to build a dashboard

### Dataset

The data consisted of csv files worth of 12 months of ride data. The total number of rows reach 5 millions.

### Task

Identifying how do annual members and casual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and then suggest the marketing team how to turn casual members into annual members.

### Analysis

The data suggests that there is a difference in behaviour between annual members and casual members in terms of the time and the distance taken by each group members when using the service. Based on that findings then the marketing team can work on the places where the behaviours between the casual members and the annual members are mostly similar.

### Result

**Clark St & Elm St**, **Wells St & Concord Ln**, and **Wells St & Elm St** are the potential locations for our marketing team to convert casual riders into member riders the most compared to another stations.

### Deliverables

- A ppt file to present the findings.
- A Power BI dashboard to compare the trends and statistical data between the 2 categories.

### Further Analysis

There are some questions that can be find and further help the marketing program:
- The most effective hours to do advertising within the area of the stations found
- For each month, find the trend of time where member riders are the most active (e.g. maybe member riders are the most active in July, so try to advertise around that time in order to maximize the conversion rate of casual riders to member riders)

A Power BI dashboard is created that can answer those 2 additional questions.
